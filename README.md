# Overview

Within this program you with go learn about different functions that you can use to edit/manipulate an array in javascript. In addintion to the functions about arrays, you will see examples of how to use recursion, how to change the color of the text in the terminal, how to use a progress bar and learn how to add error handling to your code so that you run into less problems while coding.

The JavaScript program that I have written is meant to be used as a teaching example that would help people new to the laguage understand some of the basics fuctions that relate to arrays, as well as introduce some other topics that can be complex, but give you simple easy to follow examples. These examples include recursion, using build in npm node modules and throwing/handling execptions.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I belive that the progress bar could be improved to show you when you have hit different points (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) in this program.
- I think it could be a better over all program if it was moved out of the terminal and onto a web page.
- Some more in depth examples on error handling could be extremely useful.
